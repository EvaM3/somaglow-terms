## 1) Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how SomaGlow handles information.  
SomaGlow is designed to respect your privacy. Most data stays on your device.

* * *

## 2) Data We Process

### a. Local App Data

Entries you create – such as notes, reflections, or session preferences – are stored only on your device.  
If you enable system backups (e.g., iCloud), that data is handled by Apple under their own terms and privacy policy.

### b. Purchases & Subscriptions

- Billing and payments are processed by the Apple App Store.
- We do not receive your full payment details (such as full card numbers).
- Subscription status and purchase receipts are associated with your Apple ID and handled by Apple.

We may use a third-party service (such as RevenueCat) to help manage subscription status and entitlements.  
This service works with anonymized identifiers and purchase receipts; it does not give us access to your full payment details.

### c. Diagnostics

Crash or performance logs may be shared by your device/OS to improve stability.  
We do not personally identify you from these logs.

* * *

## 3) No Third-Party Tracking

SomaGlow does not include analytics SDKs or advertising trackers.  
We do not sell or rent personal information.

* * *

## 4) Legal Bases (EEA/UK)

Where applicable, processing relies on:

- Performance of a contract (to deliver app features)  
- Legitimate interests (security, stability)  
- Consent (where required by law)

* * *

## 5) Your Rights

You may request access, correction, deletion, or portability of any data we hold (for example, support emails you send us).  
Email us at **eva.madarasz3@gmail.com** — we typically reply within 1–2 business days (Mon–Fri, CET).

For purchases, refunds, or billing data, please contact **Apple Support**, as those are handled through your Apple ID.

* * *

## 6) Data Deletion

To delete any data associated with your purchases or communication, email us with the subject:  
**“SomaGlow Data Deletion Request”** and include the Apple ID used with the app.

To remove local app data, delete entries inside SomaGlow or uninstall the app from your device.

* * *

## 7) Children

SomaGlow is intended for users who have reached the age of digital consent in their country (typically 16+ in the EEA).  
If you believe a child has provided data to us, contact us so we can remove it.

* * *

## 8) International Transfers

If data is processed outside your region, appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) are used where required by law.

* * *

## 9) Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.  
The latest Effective Date above reflects the current version.  
Continued use of the app after updates means acceptance of the revised Policy.
